</h1>


**lupos** is a framework to support component-based programming in TypeScript.

It was designed to solve two problems in web programming, which are hard to solve by experience or programming design:

- Observing data changes - by TypeScript aot analysis
- Efficiently update after data changes - by pre-compiling template literal

Currently it serves project [lupos.js](https://github.com/pucelle/lupos.js), and will serve [lupos.paint](https://github.com/pucelle/lupos.paint) later.

[lupos-vscode](https://github.com/pucelle/lupos-vscode) is the vscode plugin provides Syntax Highlighting and IntelliSense for **lupos**.



**lupos** includes two parts:

- `cli` provides command line which uses internal TypeScript Transformer to compile **lupos** based projects.
- `web` is the runtime that needs to be imported from your projects.



## Features

### 1. Property Get and Set Tracking

If an object should be observed, **lupos** will track get and set actions of it's properties and even descendant properties, then inject statements besides like `trackGet` and `trackSet`.

Compare with some modern tracking ways like **Proxy**, **Signal**, **State**..., **lupos** is:

- No need to design or even pay attention to data tracking, it naturally works after declared type as **Observed**.
- Much more efficient, additionally lupos will merge tracking statements and hoist them when possible to improve performance.
- Can easily debug data tracking by compiled statements.


#### Become Observed

Here are the rules to decide whether an object should be observed:

- `class XXX implements Observed {...}`: class child properties and descendant properties become observed, also affect derived classes.
- `(variable as Observed<...>)`: variable becomes observed if it's **as** `Observed`.
- `interface T extends Observed{...}; let variable = T`: if an interface extends Observed, which's type resolved to type `T` becomes observed.
- `<T extends Observed<...>>`: which's type resolved as type parameter `T` becomes observed.
- `class {property: Observed<...>}`: property becomes observed if it's type is `Observed`.
- `let variable: Observed<...> = ...`: declared variable becomes observed if it's type is declared as `Observed`.
- `let variable = xxx as Observed<...>`: declared variable becomes observed if it's initializer is declared as `Observed`.



#### Observed State Broadcasting

Normally observed state of an object will broadcast to it's properties:

- `readonly property`: readonly property get or set action is not tracked, but still broadcast observed state to property value.
- `list.map(item => ...)`: if `list` is observed, broadcast to `item`.
- `UnObserved<...>`: which's resolved type is `UnObserved` become not observed.
- `$variable / $property / $parameter`: which's name starts with `$` become not observed.



#### Examples

```ts
class Example implements Observed {
	value: number = 0;
	get(): number {
		return this.value;
	}
	set(value: number) {
		this.value = value;
	}
}
```

After compiled:

```js
class Example {
	value = 0;
	get() {
		trackGet(this, 'value');
		return this.value;
	}
	set(value) {
		trackSet(this, 'value');
		this.value = value;
	}
}
```



### 2. Template compiling

- compile `html` and `svg` template of [lupos.js](https://github.com/pucelle/lupos.js), and `paint` template of [lupos.paint](https://github.com/pucelle/lupos.paint) to vanilla codes, and hoist codes to optimize.
- compile `css` template of [lupos.js](https://github.com/pucelle/lupos.js) to compress it.



## APIs

### 1. cli APIs

- `luc`: compile lupos based project by typescript and transformer.
- `luc -e`: compile to esm codes, import paths will be resolved to file path, so outputted codes can do tree shaking easier.
- `luc -w`: compile in watch mode.


### 2. web APIs

- **Component**:
	- `@setContext`: decorates a component property to declare a context variable. Target component must extend `ContextVariableConstructor`.
	- `@useContext`: decorates a component property to reference a context variable defined in any ancestral component. Target component must extend `ContextVariableConstructor`.

- **Events**:
	- `DOMEvents`: bind document events, especially when scope needs to bind.
	- `DomModifiableEvents`: bind document events with modifiers, like `prevent`, `stop`, `Enter`...
	- `EventFirer`: help to bind and fire event.
	- `EventKeys`: help to get event key and code of an key events.

- **Observer**:
	- **Decorators**: note these decorators get updated in their declaration order.
		- `@computed`: decorates a class getter to make it compute value when required, and refresh result when required.
		- `@effect`: decorates a class method, it execute this method, and if any dependency it used get changed, re-execute.
		- `@watch(publicProperty / getterFn)`: decorates a class method to watch value of a property or returned value of a getter function, and calls current method after this value changed.
		- `@watchMulti(...)`: same as `@watch`, except it watches several properties or getter functions.

	- **Tracking functions**:
		- `beginTrack(callback)`: begin to capture dependencies. refresh `callback` get called when any dependencies get changed.
		- `endTrack`: end capturing dependencies.
		- `untrack(callback)`: remove all dependencies of a refresh callback.
		- `trackGet`: when doing property getting, add a dependency.
		- `trackSet`: when doing setting property, notify the dependency is changed.
		- `trackGetDeeply`: when need to track all properties and descendant properties of an object recursively of an object as dependency. Like `JSON.stringify(...)`.
		- `proxyOf`: proxy an object or an array, map or set (not weak map or weak set), and all the descendant properties of them. It's the final way of observing when other ways fail.

	- **Queue**
		- `enqueueUpdate`: enqueue a callback with a scope, will call it before the next animate frame.
		- `enqueueAfterDataApplied`: enqueue a callback with a scope, will call it before all watchers / effectors / computers to be called, and after all components update callbacks.
		- `untilUpdateComplete`: returns a promise which will be resolved after all the enqueued callbacks were called.
		- `untilFirstPaintCompleted`: Returns a promise, which will be resolved after the first time update complete, and browser paint completed.

	- **Utils**
		- `AnimationFrame`: request to call `callback` in current or before next animation frame.
		- `bindCallback`: bind callback with scope.
		- `promiseWithResolves`: returns a promise, with it's resolve and reject.



## Weakness

**lupos** is not perfect yet.

- Can only work with TypeScript, and slows TypeScript compiling speed.
- If a library made by **lupos**, normally places use this library should also be compiled by **lupos**. There are some alternative solutions existing, which will be provided when required.
- Some expressions, like `let newItems = observedItems.filter(...)`, you may expect `newItems` to become observed, but in fact it's not. Plan to indicate observed state of expressions by vscode plugin decorate feature.



## FAQ

### Why name is **lupos**?

When I first started implementing this library in 2024, I was playing WoW Classic, and just tamed my lifelong companion **Lupos**.

I hope this library will play the roles in my development just like **Lupos** in my WoW adventures.

### What's origin of this library?


#### 2013

In 2013, I'm learning AngularJS, but find it's source code is incredibly difficult to understand, so I created a [small library](https://github.com/purhya/vm-2013) which helps me to understand it.

During coding, I realized expressions like `$bind="name"` will change `name` property. So naturally after `name` property changed, only need to update places like `{{name}}` where replies on `name` property, so I implemented it.


#### 2017

In 2017, drawing from my experience in AngularJS and VueJS, I wrote a [new library](https://github.com/purhya/vm-2017). This library focus on component implementation, and uses **Proxy APIs** to track object properties.

The new tracking system with **Proxy APIs** make it performs like a real library, but brings new problems -- besides performance issues, the primary is: the proxied object becomes another object, not original.

This led me to search for a better and simpler solution.


#### 2019

In 2019, I created [flit.js](https://github.com/purhya/flit.js), it gets inspired by [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/) and adopt `` html`...` `` syntax for component templates.

This library made a big progress, but I still hadn't discovered a solution to replace **Proxy APIs** for property tracking.


#### 2022

In 2022, on the bus heading to my hometown, I suddenly realized I can implement a TypeScript Transformer, which simply inject `trackGet` and `trackSet` besides to do properties tracking, similar to what I did in 2013, but empowered by TypeScript. After a full cycle, everything go to it's origin.


#### 2024

The work had finally began, what's unexpected is that it's much harder than I thought before.

Finally it comes out, [flit](https://github.com/pucelle/flit) and some internal apps prove it works, and efficient.
